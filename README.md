Okay, I promise that this is the last time I will be writing raw CSS codes.

I spent 11.5 hours working on this. Yep! And no, this is too much hardwork, not smart work. I did not subscribe for this.

I am running right away to learn Bootsrap, Tailwind, Django or any of the host of existing frameworks.

T for Tenks.
